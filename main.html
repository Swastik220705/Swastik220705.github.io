  <h2>3. Blanket Weaving</h2>
    <div class="content">  <p style="text-align:justify">The blanket weaving is done by Nepalese women. The blankets are normally woven with sheep wool. For weaving, first of all, raw wool is washed with soap to remove all dirt and is sun-dried: raw wool is brushed with carder brush for 2-3 days. The next process is spinning the yarn out of raw wool, which takes quite some time. A wooden instrument called. the phang is required to hold the yarn, which is done manually by hands. After the spinning process is over. the yarn is given colour. Chemical dyes or natural dyes like walnut bark, majito, shungey, etc. are used to produce different colour. Finally, in the weaving process, yarn of different shades is used and the taan or the main support for the weave is inserted to the iron steel reeds on the loom. The dyed woolen yarn is then ready to be woven into the blankets according to design.</p>

  <h2>4. Thanka Painting</h2>
    <div class="content">
    <p style="text-align:justify">The thankas are the religious scrolls found hung in monasteries and houses of Buddhists. These are basically life sketches of Lord Buddha, Goddess Doma (Tara), or Guru Padmasambhava. A thanka serves as an ostensible symbol of the deity worshipped by the devotee, and it provides focal points for meditation. The thankas are painted by religious artisans known as Lharips. For thanka painting, first of all a rough piece of cotton is stretched on a frame and it is made smooth by sizing it with a mixture of chalk and glue. After it is dried and polished, painting is drawn on this cloth. Stone colour, vegetable dyes and two primary colours such as red and yellow are used in plenty while making a thanka painting. These two primary colures show the difference between fire and life, between material and immaterial. The orange symbolizes knowledge of the highest form of spirituality, the blue colour suggests depth, purity and infinity, while green represent the vegetable aspects.</p>
