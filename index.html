                <h2 class="content-title">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Sikkim is one of the favorite tourist destinations in India. The traditional handloom and handicrafts products of Sikkim are very popular among the tourist. But despite improvement in technology elsewhere, no noticeable change has been recorded in Sikkim. The practices of using old age tools like wooden hammer, scissors., knife, etc. should be replaced by modern tools. Research and design development unit need to establish in each district of state for generating sustainable livelihood both in urban and rural areas.</p>
